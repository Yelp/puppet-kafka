# The default replication factor for automatically created topics.
# Default to the number of brokers in this cluster.

############################# Log Flush Policy #############################

# The following configurations control the flush of data to disk. This is the most
# important performance knob in kafka.
# There are a few important trade-offs here:
#    1. Durability: Unflushed data is at greater risk of loss in the event of a crash.
#    2. Latency: Data is not made available to consumers until it is flushed (which adds latency).
#    3. Throughput: The flush is generally the most expensive operation.
# The settings below allow one to configure the flush policy to flush data after a period of time or
# every N messages (or both). This can be done globally and overridden on a per-topic basis.

# The number of messages to accept before forcing a flush of data to disk
log.flush.interval.messages=<%= @log_flush_interval_messages %>

# The maximum amount of time a message can sit in a log before we force a flush
log.flush.interval.ms=<%= @log_flush_interval_ms %>

# Per-topic overrides for log.flush.interval.ms
#log.flush.intervals.ms.per.topic=topic1:1000, topic2:3000


############################# Log Retention Policy #############################

# The following configurations control the disposal of log segments. The policy can
# be set to delete segments after a period of time, or after a given size has accumulated.
# A segment will be deleted whenever *either* of these criteria are met. Deletion always happens
# from the end of the log.

# The minimum age of a log file to be eligible for deletion
<%= @log_retention_hours ? "log.retention.hours=#{@log_retention_hours}" : "#log.retention.hours=" %>

# A size-based retention policy for logs. Segments are pruned from the log as long as the remaining
# segments don't drop below log.retention.bytes.
<%= @log_retention_bytes ? "log.retention.bytes=#{@log_retention_bytes}" : "#log.retention.bytes=" %>

# The maximum size of a log segment file. When this size is reached a new log segment will be created.
log.segment.bytes=<%= @log_segment_bytes %>

# The interval at which log segments are checked to see if they can be deleted according
# to the retention policies
log.cleanup.interval.mins=<%= @log_cleanup_interval_mins %>

############################# Zookeeper #############################

# Zookeeper connection string (see zookeeper docs for details).
# This is a comma separated host:port pairs, each corresponding to a zk
# server. e.g. "127.0.0.1:3000,127.0.0.1:3001,127.0.0.1:3002".
# You can also append an optional chroot string to the urls to specify the
# root directory for all kafka znodes.
zookeeper.connect=<%= @zookeeper_hosts.sort.join(',') %><%= @zookeeper_chroot if @zookeeper_chroot %>

# The maximum amount of time in ms that the client waits to establish a
# connection to zookeeper.
zookeeper.connection.timeout.ms=<%= @zookeeper_connection_timeout_ms %>

# Zookeeper session timeout. If the server fails to heartbeat to Zookeeper
# within this period of time it is considered dead. If you set this too low
# the server may be falsely considered dead; if you set it too high it may
# take too long to recognize a truly dead server.
